= Flat Mesher =

Automatic triangular mesh generation tool for flat buildings developed as part of the
[PRACE Summer of HPC](https://summerofhpc.prace-ri.eu/) program in 2015, for the project named
"Modelling of Wi-Fi signal propagation using the boundary element method" supervised by Michal
Merta at IT4I National Supercomputing Center.

From the 2D coordinates of the corners and the height of a building, and the grid resolution, this
tool generates the corresponding 3D mesh in VTU and BEM4I formats.

It is formed by a library, and graphical and command-line interfaces for it.

README files in subdirectories contain instructions on building and using this tool.
